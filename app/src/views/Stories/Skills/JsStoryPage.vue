      <li>
        The one and only love/hate language of the web. Been working with it since the inception of my career in web related development (2011).
      </li>
      <li>
        Worked enough plain js since getElementById, jQuery (2014-now), and SPA (Single Page App, 2019-now) based development and have lived through .prototype, callback hells and tons of $(e).click() events.
      </li>
      <li>
        Have worked with number of related js frameworks like ionic, angular and now settling down with vue, and typescripts if possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Have worked with node.js for backend stuff, through express.js. And would probably want to do more in the future.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use npm for all things frontend and backend (for js based), and bun sometimes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Not looking for react stuff. Decade still waiting for the js ecosystem to settle not. Don't have fomo fever, however still love to learn new stuff.
      </li>
      <li>
        Love async/await, and would use it all the time, whenever possible now it's becoming defacto standard to programming languages.
      </li>
